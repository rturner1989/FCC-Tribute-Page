                        Final Fantasy VII follows the story of mercenary Cloud
                        Strife, who is hired by the eco-terrorist group
                        AVALANCHE—led by Barret Wallace—to help fight the
                        mega-corporation Shinra Electric Power Company, who
                        attempts to drain the planet's lifeblood as an energy
                        source to further their profits. Apathetic to the cause,
                        Cloud initially fights for personal gain, and for the
                        promise he made to childhood friend Tifa Lockhart. Cloud
                        eventually joins forces with many others to save the
                        planet, which is threatened by Shinra and Cloud's
                        nemesis Sephiroth, and discovers a reason to fight for a
                        cause other than his own.

                        Final Fantasy VIII was directed by Yoshinori Kitase,

                        first game in the series to consistently use
                        realistically proportioned characters, and the first to
                        feature a vocal piece as its theme music in the form of
                        "Eyes on Me".

                        Final Fantasy VIII is set on a fantasy world with
                        science fiction elements, and focuses on Squall
                        Leonhart, a young SeeD mercenary hired out to various
                        missions by Balamb Garden. Squall and his friends are

                                <b>Vivi Ornitier</b>: Vivi appears at first to
                                be gullible, clumsy, and shy, often stumbling
                                over his speech lacking self-confidence. He is
                                fearful of his powers, origins, and his own
                                lifespan. Over time, he gains bravery and
                                confidence, as well as a sense of right and
                                wrong. Vivi befriends Zidane, who acts like an
                                older brother to him, and resolves to use his
                                magic to protect his new friends.
